# Binary Search Tree Patterns
## [`Abstract`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)


## A Sea of Connected Tings: Background
## A Sea of Connected Tings: Graph Invariants Representations and Algorithms 
Directed graphs, weighted graphs, acyclic graph, N-ary tree, binary tree, binary search tree, balanced binary search tree

## A Sea of Connected Tings: Traversals 
DFS, BFS
Pre-order, in-order, and post-order 
Graph and tree algorithms relations 

## [`Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List`](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)
These sub-problems may not be clearly and/or cleanly define; so you may need to create that mental model yourself 
It is import to be able to change your perspective of the problem into a narraow view of only the sub-probelm. Focus and think about the diff solutions to this sub problem
