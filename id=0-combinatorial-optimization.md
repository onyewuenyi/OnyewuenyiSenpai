## Problems 
[Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)


Over the last few months I've been working on porting rr to the Rust programming language. The port is still in-progress but many things work already. 

The project is called "The Record and Debug tool" or "rd" for short. The [repo](https://github.com/sidkshatriya/rd) is available on GitHub. It already has 30k+ lines of ported over Rust code.

I was somewhat inspired by the technical discussion in a mozilla/rr [ticket](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/2181) about porting rr to Rust even though at that point in time, I was not really a fan of the Rust programming language (though I am now!)

I hope to write a longer post about my experiences while porting rr to Rust. For today I just want to share some of the reasons why I embarked on this journey.
